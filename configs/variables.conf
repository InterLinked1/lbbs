[variables] ; Global variables to initialize on startup. See menus.conf for why this could be useful.
; Variable names without lowercase letters should be avoided, since reserved and predefined BBS variables will always be all caps.
; Some variables are defined automatically, run /variables from the sysop console to see available variables.
