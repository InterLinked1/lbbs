; One or more client sections for IRC client users
; Each of these sections roughly corresponds to an "IRC network" that can be used.

[bbs] ; the BBS's built-in IRC server. If you want to define a client for users to connect to the local BBS IRC server, you probably don't, see the NOTE below.
hostname = 127.0.0.1
port = 6667 ; Since this is a loopback connection, it's not necessary to use TLS for security.
tls = no
sasl = yes
autojoin = #general
; You *WILL* need to provide the credentials of *some* user on the BBS to connect to its IRC server, if using this mechanism.
; You can make a separate "machine" account for the IRC client, you should probably NOT put your sysop credentials here!
;username = sysop
;password = P@ssw0rd

; *** NOTE ***
; door_irc now supports the ability to dynamically specify an IRC connection string, instead of a client name from door_irc.conf.
; Thus, in menus.conf, instead of doing:
;    C = door:irc:bbs,#general|#general
; Do:
;    C = door:irc:irc://${BBS_USERNAME}@127.0.0.1:6667,#general|#general|minpriv=1
; This would make a connection to the local BBS server for the currently logged in user, to the #general channel.
; Protocol, hostname, and a channel to join are mandatory, but the username, password, and port number are optional.
; If you are connecting to the local BBS server (127.0.0.1), feel free to use irc:// instead of ircs:// since
; TLS is not strictly necessary for secure connections to localhost. The connection will be secure either way.
; However, keep in mind the user will not get a +z user mode if irc:// is used and will not be able to join
; channels with the +S mode set. For this reason, you may want to use ircs:// anyways if your server has a certificate.
; Additionally, SASL is used with ircs:// for authentication but NOT with irc://.
;
; Note that there are a few caveats with using this mechanism to keep in mind:
; 1) Yes, irc:irc looks weird but that is the right syntax. Use irc:// for plain text and ircs:// for TLS.
; 2) Note that this will result in a *SECOND* node connection being used.
;    The 1st connection is the user's terminal session, and the 2nd one is door_irc running an IRC client
;    that connects to the IRC server as that user. Thus, users will appear logged into the BBS twice and occupy 2 nodes for the IRC session duration.
;    In the future, it may be possible to do this in the same node, but the current architecture of net_irc does not currently make this feasible.
; 3) Users will be prompted for their password in order to set up the connection, since the IRC server will require
;    authentication, and it doesn't know (or care) the connection is coming from the BBS.
;    In theory, you could provide a password using username:password format, but there isn't a ${BBS_PASSWORD} variable
;    or any way you can dynamically inject the user's password (nor should there be!) so the user will have to type it in again.
;    A future improvement may make it possible so that the IRC server internally will authenticate connections of this type.
; 4) You probably want minpriv=1, since only registered users will be able to (relatively) seamlessly connect this way.
;    This is because for guests, ${BBS_USERNAME} will not resolve to a registered user that the IRC server will accept.
