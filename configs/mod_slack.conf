; Relay settings:
;relaysystem=yes    ; Whether to relay non-message related actions (e.g. JOIN, QUIT). Default is no.
;ircuser=jsmith     ; If configured, will make this a "personal" 1:many relay instead of a "many:many" relay.
                    ; Only this IRC user will be able to use this relay, and relayed messages will not be prefixed with the IRC username.
                    ; If this user is on IRC but not in a relayed channel, the user will be automatically invited to channels with activity.
                    ; Messages posted from IRC will not be tagged with your username, so they will appear to be coming from you
                    ; (generally, it is appropriate to use a user token with this feature, as opposed to a bot token).
                    ; Access to the channel itself is not inherently restricted by default, but other users cannot post over the relay (though they can to the IRC side),
                    ; and if other members are present in the channel when a message is posted, they will be kicked.
                    ; For example, the channel topic, if set on Slack, will be set as the IRC channel's topic, and is not private.
                    ; Additionally, since personal relays don't generally make sense to share between IRC users, it is recommended that
                    ; you use the modeless channel prefix (+) instead of the network channel prefix (#). +-prefixed channels in LBBS are "private namespace channels".
                    ; These are treated specially in that the IRC channel exists in a namespace private to the specified user, so access is automatically restricted.
                    ; It also prevents naming conflicts since the channels exist in separate namespaces; the channel +test for two different users refers to two different channels.
                    ; If you do not use the + channel prefix, you can manually restrict channel access by normal mechanisms, e.g. using ChanServ or the appropriate channel modes.
;preservethreading=no ; If the first word of a message relayed from IRC to Slack consists of a thread ID followed by a colon,
                      ; then that message will be replied to "in thread" (without the thread ID prefixed). This allows transparently preserving Slack threading from IRC.
                      ; Default is 'no'.
;prefixthread=no    ; Whether to prefix messages sent to IRC with the Slack thread ID. Default is 'no'.
                    ; If prefixed, messages will be prefixed with the thread ID. Additionally,
                    ; for messages that are replies in a thread, a '>' will be prefixed to the message to distinguish replies from top-level messages.
                    ; This option is mainly useful if preservethreading=yes, since it allows IRC users to copy and paste the thread ID for a reply.
                    ; To reply in thread in the most recently active thread, the message can be prefixed with simply '>' (followed by a space), for convenience.
;mapping=ws1-map    ; Name of config section that provides specific channel mappings.

[ws1-map]           ; Config section with mappings for the relay. Must be provided, unless prefix= is specified.
type = mapping      ; Type of config section
                    ; In general, it's recommended to use mapping=* for small workspaces (where you are interested in all channels),
                    ; and to use an explicit channel map otherwise.
; Pairs of channel mappings for relay usage. If a channel does not appear here, it will not be relayed.
                    ; IRC channels should be unique (even amongst separate maps). If they are not, messages from Slack will only be relayed to one of the channels, and vice versa.
                    ; Normal Slack channels begin with a 'C', while direct messages start with a 'D'.
                    ; Direct messages can be added, but also can be messaged privately via normal IRC mechanisms.
C123 = #ws1-general  ; #ws1-general on IRC is mapped to channel ID 123 on Slack
C556 = #ws1-help     ; #ws1-help on IRC is mapped to channel ID 556
