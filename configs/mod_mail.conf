; mod_mail - General mail configuration for SMTP/POP/IMAP

[general]
maildir=/home/bbs/maildir ; Where users' email is stored.
;catchall=sysop ; Optionally specify a mailbox that will accept mail for any nonexistent mailbox on the domain.
                ; WARNING: You could open the catchall mailbox up to receiving a lot of spam by enabling this!
			    ; The specified catch all mailbox must belong to a user directly (it cannot be an alias).
			    ; Default is none (disabled unless specified).
quota=10000000  ; Default maximum mail quota (in bytes), allowed per mailbox. Default is 10 MB.
                ; A per-mailbox quota override can be imposed by specifying the quota in bytes in a .quota file in a mailbox's root maildir.
trashdays=7     ; Number of days messages can stay in Trash before being automatically permanently deleted.
                ; If set to 0, messages are not automatically deleted.

; The BBS mail servers provide a rich suite of email functionality, including:
; - SMTP, POP3, IMAP
; - Filtering
; - Mailbox storage quotas
; - Aliases
; - Mailing lists
; - Standard IMAP ACLs
; - Shared mailboxes (both "Other Users" for personal mailboxes shared with other users and "Shared Folders" for group or public mailboxes)
;
; Limitations:
; Currently, the mail server only supports a single domain (the domain of the BBS, as configured in nodes.conf)
;
; Configuration:
; - Aliases and mailing lists are configured in this configuration file (see below sections)
; - Personal mailboxes are automatically created for users as they are needed
; - Users may share their personal mailbox folders using standard IMAP ACL support.
;   For example, the IMAP-ACL-Extension add-on for Thunderbird-based clients lets users manipulate ACLs from their mail clients.
;   These mailboxes will appear in the "Other Users" IMAP namespace, for users with whom they are shared.
; - Shared mailboxes must be manually created and the permissions must be manually set. By default, nobody has any permissions for a shared mailbox.
;   A directory with the username of the mailbox should be created in the root maildir.
;   Then, a .acl file should be created inside it, using the same format as the .acl files in other mailboxes.
;   e.g. to grant the sysop full permissions, you might create a .acl file with "sysop lrswipkxteacd" as the contents (without quotes, followed by a LF (newline))
;   Then, using your IMAP client, you can assign any remaining permissions in a more convenient manner. Avoid manually modifying the .acl files if possible.
;   Rights may be negated by prefixing the user with a - (your IMAP ACL management client may handle this automatically for you).
;   The special keywords "anyone" and "authenticated" may be used in lieu of a username, to refer to any IMAP user and any authenticated IMAP user, respectively.
;   These permissions are used if they exist and there is no explicit match for the current user.
;   IMAP ACLs are not used for "send as" capabilities, even for shared mailboxes. Instead, a .senders file in the root maildir of a mailbox lists
;   all users who are authorized to send mail as a certain address, using a LF-separated list of usernames. This file must be manually created and managed as needed.
; - Virtual mailboxes may be created which essentially proxy a mailbox tree to a remote IMAP server, using the .imapremote file created in a user's root maildir.
;   These may be defined as a LF delimited list of pipe-separated folder|IMAP URL pairs, e.g.
;   Other Users.foobar|imaps://username@example.com:password@imap.example.com:993

[aliases]
; Any email address aliases to create.
; Note that usernames take precedence over aliases,
; so if a username "postmaster" exists, the alias will never be used.
; You should ensure that any aliases listed below cannot actually
; be used as valid account names, or email may go to the wrong place.
; You can control this in mod_auth_mysql.conf.
;webmaster = sysop
;postmaster = sysop

[lists] ; Listservs (can only contain local BBS addresses).
         ; Lists may contain any number of local and external recipients.
         ; * expands to "all local users".
		 ; The part before the | is a list of recipients (either usernames or full email addresses).
		 ; The part after the |, if specified, denotes users that are authorized to send mail to this list.
		 ; The default is anyone may send mail to the list (including external users).
		 ; WARNING: You can include external email addresses in the authorized senders list, but this may be vulnerable to spoofing.
		 ; Use at your own risk. It is recommended you explicitly provide an authorized senders list, limited to specific local users or * when possible.
;everyone = *|* ; Email list that sends to all local users. All local users may post to this list.
;announcements = *|sysop ; Email list that sends to all local users. Only user "sysop" may post to this list.
;public = sysop,sysop2,sysop3 ; Email list with 3 recipients, that anyone (local or external) may send messages to.
;sysops = sysop,newsreader,jsmith|sysop,newsreader,jsmith  ; Email list containing users sysop, newsreader, and jsmith (only these users can send to this list).
