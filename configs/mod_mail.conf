; mod_mail - General mail configuration for SMTP/POP/IMAP

[general]
maildir=/home/bbs/maildir ; Where users' email is stored.
;catchall=sysop ; Optionally specify a mailbox that will accept mail for any nonexistent mailbox on the domain.
                ; WARNING: You could open the catchall mailbox up to receiving a lot of spam by enabling this!
			    ; The specified catch all mailbox must belong to a user directly (it cannot be an alias).
			    ; Default is none (disabled unless specified).
				; The catch all address applies to ALL domains.
quota=10000000  ; Default maximum mail quota (in bytes), allowed per mailbox. Default is 10 MB.
                ; A per-mailbox quota override can be imposed by specifying the quota in bytes in a .quota file in a mailbox's root maildir.
trashdays=7     ; Number of days messages can stay in Trash before being automatically permanently deleted.
                ; If set to 0, messages are not automatically deleted.

; The BBS mail servers provide a rich suite of email functionality, including:
; - SMTP, POP3, IMAP
; - Filtering
; - Mailbox storage quotas
; - Aliases
; - Mailing lists
; - Standard IMAP ACLs
; - Shared mailboxes (both "Other Users" for personal mailboxes shared with other users and "Shared Folders" for group or public mailboxes)
;
; Limitations:
; Currently, the mail server only supports a single domain (the domain of the BBS, as configured in nodes.conf)
;
; Configuration:
; - Aliases and mailing lists are configured in this configuration file (see below sections)
; - Personal mailboxes are automatically created for users as they are needed
; - Users may share their personal mailbox folders using standard IMAP ACL support.
;   For example, the IMAP-ACL-Extension add-on for Thunderbird-based clients lets users manipulate ACLs from their mail clients.
;   These mailboxes will appear in the "Other Users" IMAP namespace, for users with whom they are shared.
; - Shared mailboxes must be manually created and the permissions must be manually set. By default, nobody has any permissions for a shared mailbox.
;   A directory with the username of the mailbox should be created in the root maildir.
;   Then, a .acl file should be created inside it, using the same format as the .acl files in other mailboxes.
;   e.g. to grant the sysop full permissions, you might create a .acl file with "sysop lrswipkxteacd" as the contents (without quotes, followed by a LF (newline))
;   Then, using your IMAP client, you can assign any remaining permissions in a more convenient manner. Avoid manually modifying the .acl files if possible.
;   Rights may be negated by prefixing the user with a - (your IMAP ACL management client may handle this automatically for you).
;   The special keywords "anyone" and "authenticated" may be used in lieu of a username, to refer to any IMAP user and any authenticated IMAP user, respectively.
;   These permissions are used if they exist and there is no explicit match for the current user.
;   IMAP ACLs are not used for "send as" capabilities, even for shared mailboxes. Instead, a .senders file in the root maildir of a mailbox lists
;   all users who are authorized to send mail as a certain address, using a LF-separated list of usernames. This file must be manually created and managed as needed.
; - Virtual mailboxes may be created which essentially proxy a mailbox tree to a remote IMAP server, using the .imapremote file created in a user's home directory.
;   These may be defined as a LF delimited list of pipe-separated folder|IMAP URL pairs, e.g.
;   Other Users.foobar|imaps://username@example.com:password@imap.example.com:993

[domains] ; Any domains that are considered "local" to the BBS mail server, i.e. the MX records for these domains point to the BBS.
          ; Only messages to these domains will be accepted from external recipients.
          ; Sent messages to these domains will be delivered locally, and messages to other domains will be delivered using SMTP.
		  ; The BBS hostname configured in nodes.conf is always considered local by default, and does not need to be explicitly added here.
		  ; Only the key is used for this section, the value can be any arbitrary value.
		  ; Refer to the [aliases] section for multi-domain handling implications.
		  ;
		  ; WARNING: Note that the multi-domain support in this mail server is somewhat rudimentary.
		  ; The primary BBS hostname is the primary email domain for mailboxes.
		  ; Addresses at other domains can only be aliased to other mailboxes. Independent accounts cannot be made for other domains.
		  ; By default, any email to secondary domains will be dropped (unless a catch-all address exists). Aliases must be defined
		  ; to map email to specific usernames at secondary domains to existing mailboxes.
		  ; Users can receive mail to addresses at secondary domains and send mail from those domains, but only using their primary mailbox.
		  ; You could emulate an independent mailbox by creating a shared mailbox and alias an address to that,
		  ; but this shared mailbox will still need to be accessed through another "primary" mailbox, i.e. it's not a separate IMAP account.
		  ; There is simply no way around this since email authentication has a 1:1 mapping to BBS accounts.
		  ;
		  ; For many use cases, this functionality should suffice.
		  ; This is obviously NOT suitable for use cases like commercial email hosting, etc.
		  ; It is probably perfectly fine for use cases such as a personal mail server, where
		  ; you want to be able to manage multiple email addresses from a single email account.
;example.com=yes

[aliases]
; Any email address aliases to create.
; Note that usernames take precedence over aliases,
; so if a username "postmaster" exists, the alias will never be used.
; You should ensure that any aliases listed below cannot actually
; be used as valid account names, or email may go to the wrong place.
; You can control this in mod_auth_mysql.conf.
;
; If you have multiple domains, you should note the following:
; Simply specifying a username here will apply to ALL domains handled by the BBS mail server.
; You can specify the entire user@domain to match only for a particular address.
; The righthand value must be a valid mailbox name on the system (username or shared mailbox).
; You can specify the domain explicitly to restrict the match to that particular address.

; There are several addresses required by various RFCs (e.g. RFCs 822, 1033, 1034, 1035, 2142).
; Make sure that these route somewhere logical (e.g. to the sysop):

;webmaster = sysop
;hostmaster = sysop
;postmaster = sysop
;news = sysop
;abuse = sysop

;test@bbs.example.com = sysop
