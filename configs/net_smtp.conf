; net_smtp - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server configuration

; Additional configuration is required in mod_mail.conf

[general]
relayin=yes ; Whether to accept external mail for local recipients. Default is yes.
relayout=yes ; Whether to relay outgoing mail to external recipients from local users. Default is yes.
; In case you're wondering, neither of these settings will turn your SMTP server into an open mail relay.
; This is fortunately not a supported configuration, so you won't accidentally open your server to spammers.
notifyqueue=no ; Whether to notify users that a queued message they have attempted to send has not yet been successfully delivered yet.
               ; I'm not aware of any mail servers that do this, this is a unique feature added for users that might find this convenient.
               ; The benefit of this is that users are notified a message they sent hasn't been successfully delivered, in advance
               ; of delivery ultimately failing and triggering a final nondelivery response to return the message to them.
               ; Default is no.
queueinterval=600 ; Seconds between queue retries. Minimum is 60. Default is 60. Recommended values are 60-600.
                  ; Note that increasing this will increase the retry times initially,
                  ; but since exponential backoff is used for delivery retry, this setting will only affect shorter retries.
                  ; Queue retries will thus be lowerbound by this setting, but any retires that would have happened further apart are not affected.
maxretries=10  ; Number of times to attempt to deliver a message. If exceeded, message will be returned. Default and recommended value is 10.
               ; It is recommended that this be at least 10, to retry delivery for at least a few days before returning to sender.
maxage=86400   ; Maximum age of a queued email that will be retried, before being returned.
maxsize=300000 ; Maximum size of an email message, in bytes. Messages larger than this will be rejected. Default is 300,000 (appx. 300 KB)
maxhops=20 ; Maximum number of hops (indicated by count of Received headers). Default is 100, per RFC 5321, but you will likely want to set this lower
           ; to end mail loops earlier rather than later (though not so low that legitimate mail is rejected). Maximum value is 100.
requirefromhelomatch=yes ; Require the MAIL FROM domain to match the domain advertised by the sending server in HELO/EHLO.
                         ; This may cause some mail to get rejected.
						 ; In particular, if you are proxiying email to the BBS via another MTA (e.g. postfix) on the same server,
						 ; you should disable this since the HELO would not match.
validatespf=yes     ; Whether to do SPF validation for incoming messages. Default is yes.
addreceivedmsa=no   ; Whether to include the sender's IP address in the Received header for messages submitted by Message Submission Agents (mail clients) for delivery.
                    ; Technically this should always be done, according to RFC 5321 3.7.2,
					; but some mail servers no longer do this to protect their users' privacy
					; (in fact, Google is the only major mail provider I know of that still does this).
					; If this setting is enabled, recipients will be able to see the sender's real IP address,
					; which may constitute an unreasonable breach in privacy for your users.
					; Default is no (header still added, but IP address masked).
notifyextfirstmsg=yes ; Whether to send an email to a user's external email address when his/her mailbox is first created.
                      ; Default is yes.

[smtp]
enabled=yes ; If you want to receive external email, do not disable this unless you know what you are doing.
port=25 ; Port for SMTP relay acceptance (for mail transfer agents). Default is 25.
;requirestarttls=yes ; Require STARTTLS for outgoing email. This will ensure sent emails
                     ; cannot be sent in the clear due to a protocol downgrade attack.
					 ; Note that enabling this may break compatibility with some mail servers,
					 ; as not all SMTP MTAs allow STARTTLS. If this setting is enabled,
					 ; and the message cannot be delivered securely, delivery will fail.
					 ; Default is no.

[smtps]
enabled=yes
port=465 ; Port for SMTPS message submission agents, with implicit TLS. Default is 465.

[msa]
enabled=yes
port=587 ; Port for SMTP message submission agents using STARTTLS. Default is 587.
requirestarttls=yes ; Require STARTTLS for message submission agents. Default is yes.
                    ; Note that STARTTLS cannot be enforced for regular SMTP MTA. RFC 3207 says this MUST NOT be done.
					; In practice, this option must always be effectively enabled, since PLAIN and LOGIN authentication
					; are only supported on secure connections, and authentication is required for message submission agents.

[privs]
;relayin=1   ; Minimum privilege level required to accept external email for a user.
;relayout=1  ; Minimum privilege level required to relay external email outbound for a user.
             ; e.g. Set to 2 or higher if you want to prevent new users that haven't been verified/
			 ; had their privilege levels increased by the sysop from sending external email.

; NOTE: Functionally, the services provided by these listeners are mostly identical.
; The SMTP and SMTPS listeners allow both Mail Transfer Agent and Message Submission Agent connections,
; i.e. they can be used to receive incoming mail and send outgoing mail.
; The MSA listener may only be used to send outgoing mail, and is not encrypted by default (STARTTLS must be used for a secure MSA connection).
; In practice, mail clients can use either SMTPS (465) or STARTTLS (587) for sending email. You can choose to support both, if you want.
; Nowadays, it may be preferable to use SMTPS on 465 to prevent man-in-the-middle downgrade attacks: see RFC 8314 section 3.3.
; In practice, either is sufficiently secure so long as you enforce the use of TLS/STARTTLS on the server and your clients.

; Note that although you are free to operate SMTP MTA/MSA services on whatever ports you desire,
; you are likely to have problems receiving inbound mail for your users if you do not operate
; conventional SMTP on port 25.

[logging] ; SMTP log file configuration. This log contains SMTP transaction info in a concise log for archival or debugging purposes.
; Nitty gritty low-level details are only present in the regular BBS debug messages.
logfile=/var/log/lbbs/smtp.log ; SMTP logfile. If set, SMTP messages up to the SMTP log level will be logged to this file.
loglevel=5 ; Log level from 0 to 10 (maximum debug). Default is 5.

; The next three sections define different types of relays. For a simple MTA, you can ignore these sections.
; Some of these settings are complementary, but they are different. In a nutshell:
; [authorized_relays] = hosts allowed to relay outgoing mail through us (per-domain)
; [static_relays] = static definitions of how to deliver mail to the "next hop" per-domain. This is BOTH:
;                   - hosts allowed to relay incoming mail through us and to what hosts (per-domain)
;                   - hosts through which all our outgoing mail is relayed
; [trusted_relays] = hosts allowed to relay our incoming mail to us

[starttls_exempt]	; This option complements the requirestarttls setting in [msa].
					; Even when that option is enabled, specific hostnames/IP addresses/CIDR ranges can be exempted from this requirement,
					; e.g. to allow hosts on a private intranet to submit outgoing mail without using TLS
					; while requiring it for all public connections.
					; Only the key is used to define an exemption, the config value is ignored.
127.0.0.1 = exempt

[blacklist] ; Domains or email addresses that we will not accept mail from (empty by default)
            ; WARNING: The blacklist applies to ALL MAILBOXES. Be careful about adding things here.
;example.com = no ; The actual value does not matter, just specify the domain to blacklist on the left hand side of the assignment.
;jsmith@example.com = no ; You can also blacklist individual email addresses.

[authorized_relays] ; Define remote hosts that are allowed to relay outgoing mail using this server as a smart host.
; Configure each authorized relay as an IP/hostname/CIDR range and a list of domains or subdomains for which they are authorized to relay mail.
; If a connection matches multiple entries, the relay is allowed as long as it matches one of the entries.
; WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING: Misconfiguration of this section may inadvertently turn your server into an open mail relay!
;      The BBS will not perform any further checks of messages authorized by one of these entries and will simply relay messages as directed.
;      If further verification of messages is required, the submitting SMTP server/client must do it (e.g. checking the sender is authorized to send as a particular user).
;      Do not attempt to relay mail for domains that *THIS* server is not authorized to send as (otherwise failed SPF checks, etc. will likely get you blacklisted quickly).
;
;10.1.1.5 = example.com,example.net ; Messages from 10.1.1.5 may be relayed for example.com and example.net
;10.1.1.6 = example.org

[static_relays] ; Define remote hosts for which the BBS will accept and forward incoming mail to another mail transfer agent. These bypass an MX lookup.
                ; This can be used both for accepting incoming mail for another mail server or for routing outbound mail via a smart host.
                ;
                ; You might configure this at a public-facing site to forward mail to other sites that cannot directly receive mail from the Internet on port 25, e.g. over a VPN tunnel.
                ; The public MX records for these domains would point to this host, and this host would forward it to the real mail servers for those domains.
                ; You will most likely also want to configure the BBS to accept and relay mail for the corresponding IP/domain in [authorized_relays]
                ; Only static IP addresses (no hostnames or CIDR ranges) are allowed for values in this section.
                ; Domains must be explicitly enumerated; no wildcards for subdomains.
                ;
                ; Static relays may only be used in lieu of MX lookups that would have been performed, if configured,
                ; i.e. messages addressed to an IP address (domain literal) do not use static routes.
                ;
                ; On the mail server for domains which are proxied through this host, the '*' rule can be used to route all outgoing mail through another host.
;example.com = 10.1.1.5
;example.net = 10.1.1.5,10.1.1.6 ; Try 10.1.1.5 first, then 10.1.1.6 as a fallback (like with higher priority MX records)
;example.org = 10.1.1.6:2525 ; If the remote mail transfer agent is listening on a non-standard port (not 25), you can specify the port explicitly.
;* = 10.1.1.4 ; This rule is special. Rather than looking up via MX record, outgoing mail will be relayed via this "smart host" instead. Useful when outgoing port 25 is blocked.
              ; You will likely also want to add this server to [trusted_relays] if it also handles your incoming mail.

[trusted_relays] ; These hosts are allowed to accept mail on our behalf and forward it to us.
                 ; This applies to ALL mail from ALL originating MTAs. This will inhibit certain
                 ; checks that are done on incoming mail by default, such as doing a reverse lookup
                 ; on the sender, which would otherwise fail due to the intermediary SMTP host that
                 ; originally accepted the message for us from the sending MTA.
                 ; Adding a host here indicates that that server has already performed these checks,
                 ; and they will not be performed again here since it would not be possible to do so.
                 ; If both your incoming and outgoing mail goes through a certain host, it should be listed
                 ; in both this section as well as the * rule for [static_relays].
                 ; However, depending on the networking arrangement between the two MTAs, note that the
                 ; IP addresses COULD be different, e.g. if using a NATed VPN tunnel.
                 ; If in doubt, send an email that is received by this host, confirm the immediately upstream IP,
                 ; and then whitelist that here.
;10.1.1.3 = yes  ; The actual value does not matter and is ignored.
;10.1.0.0/24 = yes ; CIDR ranges and hostnames are also acceptable.

[authorized_senders] ; Mapping of additional identities as which a user is allowed to send email.
; This is intended for if you want to allow users to submit outgoing mail on this server using these addresses,
; even though their incoming mail may be handled elsewhere. This mail will then be accepted and either
; delivered using an MX record lookup or by the static routes defined in [static_relays].
; The domains of the identites used here do NOT need to be configured in [domains] in mod_mail.conf.
;
; An alternate is using the RELAY MailScript rule to submit mail using the message submission service for that domain.
;
; WARNING: Before adding any identites, you SHOULD ensure that any domains with identities included below
; authorize the host sending mail to the Internet (e.g. via SPF/DKIM). There are typically two scenarios:
; 1. The public IP address of this server's egress to the Internet is authorized. In this case,
;    you're good to go.
; 2. This server's public IP address is not authorized. In this case, you should ensure a "smart host"
;    is configured through the [static_relays] section, to relay outgoing mail for these domains
;    (and possibly all email traffic) to another SMTP server which IS authorized.
;
; In other words, ensure that you have the necessary SPF records set up for your domain,
; and ensure that you have the correct static routes in place to ensure it egresses appropriately
; and not from an unauthorized IP address. If an upstream "smart host" handles DKIM signing
; for domains configured here, then you don't need to do it on this server, which can simply
; configuration in a private mail routing network by allowing you to centralized signing on the egress server.
;
;john = john@example.com,*@john.example.net ; Allow local user 'john' to submit outgoing mail additionally using john@example.com or *@john.example.net
;jane = * ; Allow local user 'jane' to submit outgoing mail using ANY identity (DANGEROUS!)
