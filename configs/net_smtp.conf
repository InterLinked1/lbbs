; net_smtp - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server configuration

; Additional configuration is required in mod_mail.conf

[general]
relayin=yes ; Whether to accept external mail for local recipients. Default is yes.
relayout=yes ; Whether to relay outgoing mail to external recipients from local users. Default is yes.
; In case you're wondering, neither of these settings will turn your SMTP server into an open mail relay.
; This is fortunately not a supported configuration, so you won't accidentally open your server to spammers.
mailqueue=yes  ; Whether to queue outgoing mail if delivery fails initially. If disabled, if a message cannot be sent immediately, it will be rejected rather than retried later.
sendasync=yes  ; Whether to send outgoing email asynchronously. This will hand off delivery of outbound messages to a separate thread
               ; and return a 250 OK to the local sender immediately.
               ; Pro: Enabling this can thus speed up sending for mail clients significantly since they don't need to wait
               ; for the message to be received by the actual recipient.
               ; Con: Since 250 OK is always returned, delivery failures will bounce back as a delivery failure message,
               ; rather than an immediate SMTP message to the client if that would normally have been possible.
               ; If delivery fails initially, it will be queued for delivery like any other message, even if mailqueue=no.
               ; Default is yes.
alwaysqueue=no ; Whether to always queue outgoing mail rather than try to deliver it immediately first. Note that queued mail may be delayed up to queueinterval!
               ; Note that this option is somewhat redundant due to the sendasync option.
               ; Generally, you will probably want to use that option instead of this one.
               ; This option will NOT immediately queue outgoing emails for delivery, unlike sendasync.
               ; It will simply dump sent messages into the queue, and they will processed whenever the queue handler runs
               ; according to its normal schedule. This is usually only appropriate for batch emails,
               ; and not for personal messages that should be delivered immediately.
               ; Default is no.
notifyqueue=no ; Whether to notify users that a queued message they have attempted to send has not yet been successfully delivered yet.
               ; I'm not aware of any mail servers that do this, this is a unique feature added for users that might find this convenient.
               ; The benefit of this is that users are notified a message they sent hasn't been successfully delivered, in advance
               ; of delivery ultimately failing and triggering a final nondelivery response to return the message to them.
               ; Default is no.
queueinterval=900 ; Seconds between queue retries. Default is 900, minimum is 60.
maxretries=10  ; Number of times to attempt to deliver a message. If exceeded, message will be returned.
maxage=86400   ; Maximum age of a queued email that will be retried, before being returned.
maxsize=300000 ; Maximum size of an email message, in bytes. Messages larger than this will be rejected. Default is 300,000 (appx. 300 KB)
requirefromhelomatch=yes ; Require the MAIL FROM domain to match the domain advertised by the sending server in HELO/EHLO.
                         ; This may cause some mail to get rejected.
						 ; In particular, if you are proxiying email to the BBS via another MTA (e.g. postfix) on the same server,
						 ; you should disable this since the HELO would not match.
validatespf=yes     ; Whether to do SPF validation for incoming messages. Default is yes.
addreceivedmsa=no   ; Whether to include the sender's IP address in the Received header for messages submitted by Message Submission Agents (mail clients) for delivery.
                    ; Technically this should always be done, according to RFC 5321 3.7.2,
					; but some mail servers no longer do this to protect their users' privacy
					; (in fact, Google is the only major mail provider I know of that still does this).
					; If this setting is enabled, recipients will be able to see the sender's real IP address,
					; which may constitute an unreasonable breach in privacy for your users.
					; Default is no (header still added, but IP address masked).
notifyextfirstmsg=yes ; Whether to send an email to a user's external email address when his/her mailbox is first created.
                      ; Default is yes.

[privs]
;relayin=1   ; Minimum privilege level required to accept external email for a user.
;relayout=1  ; Minimum privilege level required to relay external email outbound for a user.
             ; e.g. Set to 2 or higher if you want to prevent new users that haven't been verified/
			 ; had their privilege levels increased by the sysop from sending external email.

; NOTE: Functionally, the services provided by these listeners are mostly identical.
; The SMTP and SMTPS listeners allow both Mail Transfer Agent and Message Submission Agent connections,
; i.e. they can be used to receive incoming mail and send outgoing mail.
; The MSA listener may only be used to send outgoing mail, and is not encrypted by default (STARTTLS must be used for a secure MSA connection).
; In practice, mail clients can use either SMTPS (465) or STARTTLS (587) for sending email. You can choose to support both, if you want.
; Nowadays, it may be preferable to use SMTPS on 465 to prevent man-in-the-middle downgrade attacks: see RFC 8314 section 3.3.
; In practice, either is sufficiently secure so long as you enforce the use of TLS/STARTTLS on the server and your clients.

; Note that although you are free to operate SMTP MTA/MSA services on whatever ports you desire,
; you are likely to have problems receiving inbound mail for your users if you do not operate
; conventional SMTP on port 25.

[smtp]
enabled=yes ; If you want to receive external email, do not disable this unless you know what you are doing.
port=25 ; Port for SMTP relay acceptance (for mail transfer agents). Default is 25.
;requirestarttls=yes ; Require STARTTLS for outgoing email. This will ensure sent emails
                     ; cannot be sent in the clear due to a protocol downgrade attack.
					 ; Note that enabling this may break compatibility with some mail servers,
					 ; as not all SMTP MTAs allow STARTTLS. If this setting is enabled,
					 ; and the message cannot be delivered securely, delivery will fail.
					 ; Default is no.

[smtps]
enabled=yes
port=465 ; Port for SMTPS message submission agents, with implicit TLS. Default is 465.

[msa]
enabled=yes
port=587 ; Port for SMTP message submission agents using STARTTLS. Default is 587.
requirestarttls=yes ; Require STARTTLS for message submission agents. Default is yes.
                    ; Note that STARTTLS cannot be enforced for regular SMTP MTA. RFC 3207 says this MUST NOT be done.
					; In practice, this option must always be effectively enabled, since PLAIN and LOGIN authentication
					; are only supported on secure connections, and authentication is required for message submission agents.

[blacklist] ; Domains or email addresses that we will not accept mail from (empty by default)
            ; WARNING: The blacklist applies to ALL MAILBOXES. Be careful about adding things here.
;example.com = no ; The actual value does not matter, just specify the domain to blacklist on the left hand side of the assignment.
;jsmith@example.com = no ; You can also blacklist individual email addresses.
